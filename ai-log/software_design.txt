I want to create a cli with nodejs. It is for a website that will display info about movies and movie principals. What components/classes should i use in my project? What linbraries also would be useful?

Creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) with Node.js for a movie information website involves several components and libraries to make your project efficient and user-friendly. Here's a basic structure you can consider:

Commander.js: This is a popular Node.js library for building command-line interfaces. It helps you define and parse command-line options and arguments. You can use it to create commands for listing movies, getting details about a specific movie, etc.

bash
Copy code
npm install commander
Example usage:

javascript
Copy code
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .version('1.0.0')
  .command('list', 'List all movies')
  .command('details <movie_id>', 'Get details about a specific movie')
  .parse(process.argv);
Inquirer.js: It's a powerful library for collecting user input in the command line. You can use it to prompt the user for additional information or choices.

bash
Copy code
npm install inquirer
Example usage:

javascript
Copy code
const inquirer = require('inquirer');

inquirer.prompt([
  {
    type: 'input',
    name: 'movieName',
    message: 'Enter the movie name:',
  },
  // Additional prompts as needed
])
.then(answers => {
  // Use the user's input
});
Axios or Fetch: To make HTTP requests to your movie information API. Axios is a popular choice for making HTTP requests.

bash
Copy code
npm install axios
Example usage:

javascript
Copy code
const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://api.example.com/movies')
  .then(response => {
    // Handle the API response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle errors
  });
Chalk: For adding color to your console output, making it more visually appealing.

bash
Copy code
npm install chalk
Example usage:

javascript
Copy code
const chalk = require('chalk');

console.log(chalk.green('Success!'));
console.log(chalk.red('Error!'));
Figlet: For ASCII art text, which can be used for headers or banners.

bash
Copy code
npm install figlet
Example usage:

javascript
Copy code
const figlet = require('figlet');

console.log(figlet.textSync('Movie CLI', { horizontalLayout: 'full' }));
Config File: You may consider using a configuration file (e.g., JSON or YAML) to store API endpoints, API keys, or any other configurable options.

Remember to structure your code into modular components, separating concerns, and keeping the codebase maintainable. This basic setup can be expanded upon based on the complexity and features you want to implement in your CLI application.
