I have the endpoint below 
https://localhost:9876/ntuaflix_api/title/tt0000929?format=json 

i work with postman and i have the tests below:

pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response body is valid JSON", function () {
    pm.response.to.be.json;
});
 

what else should i check

In addition to the status code and the response body being valid JSON, you may want to consider adding more specific tests based on the requirements of your API and the endpoint you are testing. Here are some additional test cases you might consider:

Response Time:

javascript
Copy code
pm.test("Response time is within acceptable range", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(1000); // adjust the threshold as needed
});
Specific Data Checks:
If your API returns specific data, you can check for the existence of certain fields or values in the response.

javascript
Copy code
pm.test("Response contains expected fields", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.json()).to.have.property('fieldName');
});

pm.test("Specific value in response body", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.json().propertyName).to.eql('expectedValue');
});
Headers Check:
Verify that the required headers are present in the response.

javascript
Copy code
pm.test("Content-Type is application/json", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.headers.get('Content-Type')).to.include('application/json');
});
Status Code Range:
Check if the status code falls within a specific range.

javascript
Copy code
pm.test("Status code is within 2xx range", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status.within(200, 299);
});
Error Handling:
If your API returns error responses, you can test the error scenarios.

javascript
Copy code
pm.test("Handle 404 Not Found", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(404);
});

// Add more tests for other possible error scenarios...
Performance Considerations:
Depending on your application requirements, you might want to consider performance-related tests such as concurrent requests, stress testing, etc.

Remember to customize these tests according to the specific behavior and requirements of your API. Additionally, you can explore Postman's scripting capabilities to further enhance and customize your test suite.

are there any more advanced tests that i should do or these are ok.
It is my first time working with postman

For someone new to Postman, the tests you've written so far cover fundamental aspects of API testing. However, as you become more familiar with your API and its behavior, you might consider more advanced testing scenarios. Here are a few additional advanced test scenarios you might explore:

Pagination Handling:
If your API supports pagination, test the pagination mechanism to ensure that it works correctly.

javascript
Copy code
pm.test("Pagination is working as expected", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.json()).to.have.property('nextPage');
});
Schema Validation:
Define a JSON schema for the expected response and validate that the actual response conforms to this schema.

javascript
Copy code
const responseSchema = {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
        // Define the expected structure here
    },
    required: ['key1', 'key2']
};

pm.test("Response body matches schema", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.jsonSchema(responseSchema);
});
Data Consistency:
Check for consistency in data, especially if your API involves data modification operations.

javascript
Copy code
pm.test("Data consistency check", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.json().field1).to.equal(pm.environment.get('expectedValue'));
});
Security Testing:
If applicable, perform security-related tests such as checking for proper authentication, authorization, and handling of sensitive data.

javascript
Copy code
pm.test("Proper authentication is enforced", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.headers.get('Authorization')).to.exist;
});
Concurrency Testing:
If your API is expected to handle concurrent requests, you can simulate concurrent requests and check for proper handling.

javascript
Copy code
// Example using the "setNextRequest" function to simulate concurrent requests
pm.test("Concurrent request test", function () {
    pm.setNextRequest('Next Request Name');
});
Negative Testing:
Test the API's robustness by deliberately sending invalid requests or edge cases.

javascript
Copy code
pm.test("Handle invalid input gracefully", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.json().error).to.exist;
});
These advanced tests provide a more comprehensive coverage of your API's functionality and behavior. Depending on your specific use case and API features, you can tailor these tests to suit your needs. Postman is a powerful tool with extensive capabilities, so feel free to explore and experiment as you become more comfortable with it.
