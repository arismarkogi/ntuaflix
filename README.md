# ntuaflix

A web application developed for the ”Software Engineering” course at NTUA, similar to IMDb. ntuaflix allows
users to search for movies and actors, providing detailed information on both. The project is built with Node.js for the
back-end, React for the front-end, and MySQL for database management.
